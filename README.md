        <hr />

<p style="color:8A565C;">Summary:</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px; color:A96060">I am the eldest of 4 in an Mexican immigrant household. I grew up to be very family-and-friend oriented. I do tend to keep to myself most of the time, but I have been trying to break out of my shell. I am currently a Marine Biology student at Montclair State University. I am not certain of what I want my future career to be, but I think I am heading towards a research direction.   </p>

<p style="color:8A565C;">Hobbies:</p>
<ul>
    <li style="color:A96060">I love to bake. I have baked all kinds of desserts but my favorite sweet to bake is cookies. There is a bais recipe and you can add so mnay different things for different flavors. </li>
    
    <li style="color:A96060">I picked up this hobby during the COVID pandemic. I also love doing jigsaw puzzles. I started out with smaller puzzles but I was finishing them quickly. I then moved up to 1000 piece puzzles and I was still completing them within a day or two. The biggest puzzle I have done was a 3000 piece SpiderMan puzzle. </li>
